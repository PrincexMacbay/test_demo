I designed and developed a test-net application website for an upcoming NFT marketplace, enabling users to apply for early access and beta testing. Leveraging my skills in front-end development with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a user-friendly interface that facilitates smooth application submissions and enhances user engagement. This project highlights my ability to conceptualize and implement effective web solutions that prepare for the successful launch of new digital platforms.
